# Music-Genre-Classification
Music genre classification is essential in many music streaming platforms, and its use is extended to various applications such as music recommendation systems, content tagging, etc. Classifying genres is a challenging task, as it contains a diverse range of musical genres, mainly when depending on single modality data. Hence, this research is concerned with classifying music genres by integrating audio and lyrics features using the Music4All dataset. This study focuses on minimizing misclassification by extracting diverse audio features, and in-depth data preprocessing for lyrics using NLP techniques. It also employs several word embedding methods, boosting models, and evaluation metrics. The comparison is made between the algorithms to find the best models and metrics for obtaining good results. The results showed that integrating all the extracted audio features by addressing class imbalance with the Doc2Vec word embedding model by utilizing XGBoost and Histgradient Boosting models achieved an F1 score of 60%, which outperformed other boosting models.
